# K2-Camera
A work around to get the camera working in fluidd.

#### This requires root access to be enabled on the printer.
<br>


Firmware updates may remove the changes so you may have to run the commands again after a firmware update.<br>
With any luck creality just implements this so we dont have to perform this modification.
